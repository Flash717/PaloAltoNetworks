# Out-er Space

## Overview

This problem set is meant to evaluate your grasp of Computer Science fundamentals
and give you an impression of what it is like to do day-to-day work for the team's
services.

You are provided the following files:

- `question.js`
- `question.py`

That way, you can implement the solution in the programming language of your choice,
whether that's Python or JavaScript. Expect to spend 1-2 hours working on the five
questions provided in the file of your choice.

The structure of the problem set is as follows:

- Problem statement
- Imports for assertions / type-hinting
- Declaration of input/sample data
- Docstrings for each of the questions you must implement
- Main function which acts as a test suite to determine correctness
- Invocation of main function

Some notes about the problem set:

- Consider using recursion to simplify your logic
- Alternatively use a stack to implement the solution iteratively
- Brush up on traversing key-value pairs in a dictionary
- Understand the difference between files and directories
- Read the test suite, as they demonstrate expected inputs and outputs
- Add breakpoints or print statements to help you debug issues
- Look at docstrings and type hinting for problems in `question.py`
- Look at docstrings for problems in `question.js`

To run the problem set locally:

- Python: `python3 question.py` / `python question.py`
- JavaScript: `node question.js`

The problem set is complete if it shows the following output:

```
run tests...
tests finished.
```

The end deliverable would be the source code file, complete with your solution
and renamed as one of the following:

- `answer.js` if you started with `question.js`
- `answer.py` if you started with `question.py`

## Bonus

Once you complete the problem set, you are free to tackle an architecture/solution
for one of the following problem domains:

- File cleanup utility that makes use of metadata about space and created/modified time
- File distribution across multiple VMs, where each VM has different space requirements
- Support content search across multiple files, using an algorithm like TF-IDF
- File similarity calculations

You are not expected to implement the whole solution for these domains. Rather, you can
selectively implement a couple of core algorithms that express your thought process
(i.e. code snippets). You can also talk about the components/services/databases that you
would use as part of your solution.

The end deliverable would be a Markdown / Word Doc / HTML file, complete with your
code snippets and proposed architecture/solution.

## Deadline

Please complete this exercise within 24 hours and send the source code file,
and bonus file if you attempted the bonus, back to the recruiter as a ZIP
file with the following filename: `firstname_takehome_mmddyyyy.zip`.
